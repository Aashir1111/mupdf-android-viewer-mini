MuPDF Mini Viewer
=================

This is a minimalist Android app using MuPDF to view PDF, XPS, CBZ,
unprotected EPUB, and FB2 documents.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need a working Android development environment, consisting of the Android
SKD and the Android NDK. The easiest way is to use Android Studio to download
and install the SDK and NDK. Make sure that the Android/Sdk/tools/bin,
Android/Sdk/platform-tools, and Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle directories are on your
path.

You also need Oracle's Java JDK (OpenJDK is not compatible with Android).
You also need Git, GNU Make, and a C compiler.

If everything is working, you should be able to run these commands
from the command line:

	Android SDK tools: android-studio, emulator, and adb.
	Android NDK tools: ndk-build.
	Oracle Java JDK 8: java, and javac.
	Git: git.
	GNU Make: make, or gmake.
	C compiler: cc, gcc, or clang.

Building
--------

Download the project using Git (and don't forget the --recursive flag):

	$ git clone --recursive git://git.ghostscript.com/mupdf-android-viewer-mini.git

If all tools have been installed as per the prerequisites, build the app
using make:

	$ make

You can also invoke the gradle wrapper manually, but then you need to run the
generate step manually:

	$ make -C libmupdf generate
	$ ./gradlew assembleDebug

The makefile will take care of building the generate step and invoking gradle
with the appropriate tasks. This is of course assuming that you have set up the
pre-requisites properly.

Running
-------

To run the app in the android emulator, first you'll need to set up an
"Android Virtual Device" for the emulator. Run "android avd" and create
a new device. You can also use Android Studio to set up a virtual device.
Use the x86 ABI for best emulator performance.

Then launch the emulator, or connect a device with USB debugging enabled:

	$ emulator -avd MyVirtualDevice &

Then copy some test files to the device:

	$ adb push file.pdf /mnt/sdcard/Download

Then install the app on the device:

	$ make install

In order to build, install, and launch the app in one step:

	$ make run

To see the error and debugging message log:

	$ adb logcat

Release
-------

To release you MUST first change the package name.
Do NOT use the com.artifex domain for your custom app!

	$ mv src/com/artifex src/com/YourCompanyName

Change all references to com.artifex.mupdf.mini into
com.YourCompanyName.mupdf.mini in the Java source files and XML resources.

In order to sign a release build, you will need to create a key and a key store.

	$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore android.keystore -alias MyKey \
		-validity 3650 -keysize 2048 -keyalg RSA

Then add the following entries to gradle.properties:

	RELEASE_KEY_STORE=android.keystore
	RELEASE_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=<your keystore password>
	RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=MyKey
	RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS_PASSWORD=<your key password>

If your keystore has been set up properly, you can now build a release APK.

	$ make release

Good Luck!
