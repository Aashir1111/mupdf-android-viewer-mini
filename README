MuPDF Mini Viewer
=================

This is a minimalist Android app using MuPDF to view PDF, XPS, CBZ,
unprotected EPUB, and FB2 documents.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need a working Android development environment, consisting of the Android
SKD and the Android NDK. The easiest way is to use Android Studio to download
and install the SDK and NDK. Make sure that the Android/Sdk/tools and
Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle directories are on your path.

You also need Oracle's Java JDK (OpenJDK is not compatible with Android).
You also need the Apache Ant build system.
You also need Git, GNU Make, and a C compiler.

If everything is working, you should be able to run these commands
from the command line:

	Android SDK tools: android, emulator, and adb.
	Android NDK tools: ndk-build.
	Oracle Java JDK 8: java, and javac.
	Apache Ant: ant.
	Git: git.
	GNU Make: make, or gmake.
	C compiler: cc, gcc, or clang.

Building
--------

Download the project using Git (and don't forget the --recursive flag):

	$ git clone --recursive git://git.ghostscript.com/mupdf-android-viewer-mini.git

If all tools have been installed as per the prerequisites, build the app
using make:

	$ make

The makefile will take care of setting up the android project and
configuration files. This is of course assuming that you have set
up the pre-requisites properly.

Running
-------

To run the app in the android emulator, first you'll need to set up an
"Android Virtual Device" for the emulator. Run "android" and in the dialog
from the "Tools > Manage AVDs..." menu, create a new device. You can also use
Android Studio to set up a virtual device. Use the x86 ABI for best emulator
performance.

Then launch the emulator, or connect an android device with USB debugging enabled:

	$ emulator -avd MyVirtualDevice &

Then copy some test files to the device:

	$ adb push file.pdf /mnt/sdcard/Download

Then install the app on the device:

	$ make install

In order to build, install, and launch the app in one step:

	$ make run

To see the error and debugging message log:

	$ adb logcat

Good Luck!
